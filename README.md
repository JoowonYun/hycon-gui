## FAQ

- ***Can I use my old wallet?***

Yes, you can. Because all of our wallets (full node, chrome extension and desktop) use same mnemonic words.

Right away. It doesn't need to sync since it connects to a fully synced remote nodes automatically.

- ***Does it support hardware wallets?***

Yes. Currently it supports <a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s" target="_blank">Ledger Nano S</a> and will add other hardware wallet supports later.

Hardware wallets are not supported in 32-bit systems due to security concerns.
